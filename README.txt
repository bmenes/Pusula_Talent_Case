In this project, we were asked to create the necessary database based on the provided case.

After creating the necessary tables in the database, we were asked to solve the following question:

Question: A store wants to track its product sales. The store has a database with product sales data. They want to analyze the sales to find the total sales amount and number of sales for each product per year. Additionally, they want to determine the product with the highest total sales amount.

For all of this, I am sharing two .sql files: one contains the code for creating the tables and inserting data, and the other contains the necessary queries to solve the given question. In the queries where I solved the question, I tried to provide the best possible solutions. For the first solution, I used a CTE (Common Table Expression), and for the second solution, I provided three different options using views, TOP 1, and subqueries. Images related to the project, including table views and results obtained from the queries, can be found in the images folder.
